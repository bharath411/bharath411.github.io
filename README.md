## üíº Work experience

**Direct Line Group | London, UK**

Senior QA Automation Engineer  | Cloud QA Engineer - May 2022 - Currently working

* Designed and implemented robust automated test frameworks using tools such as Cypress and Playwright to streamline regression and functional testing across web and API layers
* Developed and maintained comprehensive automated test suites for REST APIs using Postman and RestAssured, improving defect detection and regression coverage.
* Implemented consumer-driven contract testing using Spring Cloud Contract and Pact across microservices, enabling early API contract validation and reducing integration issues.
* Built a Proof of Concept using HyperTest for real-time contract validation, showcasing its potential to prevent production outages.
* Designed and executed robust integration testing workflows to validate inter-service communications and dependencies in complex distributed systems.
* Performed load testing using Gatling, identifying critical bottlenecks and contributing to a 30% improvement in API response times.
* Developed reusable performance testing scripts using k6 integrated with CI/CD pipelines, ensuring scalability and SLA compliance pre-release.
* Conducted static (SAST) and dynamic (DAST) security testing using tools - SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, and Burp Suite, reducing security vulnerabilities in production by 60%.
* Automated container security scans using Trivy to validate Docker images and integrated into CI/CD pipelines
* Collaborated with DevOps teams to test Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solutions developed using Terraform and Ansible
* Integrated automated (Web, API, Security scan) suites into CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions, enabling continuous validation during deployment cycles.
* Tested microservices applications' observability using Zipkin (distributed tracing system), Prometheus and Grafana
* Enhanced system observability and test execution visibility using ELK Stack, Prometheus, and Grafana, improving debugging and traceability.
* Executed chaos engineering experiments using Gremlin to evaluate system resilience
* Developed automation strategies for event-driven architectures leveraging Kafka, ensuring reliable and consistent message processing across distributed systems.
